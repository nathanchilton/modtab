TabMod is a tool for manipulating or enhancing harmonica tabs

I wrote this script to help me with my own harmonica tabs, mostly for the Lee Oskar Melody Maker Harmonica, but also for a standard diatonic in C.

It can perform two functions:
- translate hole indicators (-2 for "2 draw", +4 for "4 blow") into the actual notes being played
- shift notes up or down (in order to change keys or shift an octave)

Note: This script is very simple and has no understanding of bends or the relationship between keys.  If you know that all the notes of a song can be played by shifting your starting point from -2 to +6, it will generate the changes.
